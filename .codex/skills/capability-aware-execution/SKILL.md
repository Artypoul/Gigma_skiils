description: "Use when a request may need a specialist skill, real tool, connector, file, image, visualization, external integration, or durable artifact. Inspect what is actually available, route to the narrowest matching skill or tool, and report a gap honestly instead of inventing a capability or simulated result."

# Capability-Aware Execution

Treat the requested outcome and the available runtime as separate facts. Instructions do not create
a tool, connector, file delivery, browser, scheduler, or storage capability.

## Routing Workflow

1. Identify the requested outcome: conversational answer, source-backed answer, code change,
   durable file, visual, external action, or ongoing monitoring.
2. Check available skills first, then actual tools/connectors that are in scope.
3. Route to the narrowest matching specialist skill. For a durable artifact, load its creation
   skill before creating files.
4. Use a real tool only when it is available and authorized. Respect its confirmation and
   permission boundary.
5. If the capability is absent, name the exact gap and map it to a plugin, connector, app, or
   runtime requirement. Do not fabricate a UI, output, delivery, or integration result.
6. Verify the final artifact or external effect is accessible to the user before calling it done.

## Rules

- A request for a file means create a real file when the relevant capability is available; a
  request for explanation remains conversational unless the user asks for an artifact.
- Prefer a connected first-party tool for data in scope over browsing or guessing.
- Do not pressure a user to connect a service. State the benefit and the missing capability.
- Read `references/capability-routing.md` when the request spans several possible capabilities.
